    "text": "About This Blog\nWelcome! I’m a data analyst who believes that numbers tell stories—and those stories are all around us.\nWhat You’ll Find Here\nThis blog is my digital notebook where I document experiences and insights through the lens of data analytics. Whether I’m attending a local community event, touring a manufacturing facility, or exploring industry trends, I approach each experience with curiosity about the data behind it.\nMy Focus Areas\nI write primarily about two areas that fascinate me:\nLocal Events: I explore how data shapes and reflects our community experiences. What can attendance patterns tell us? How do local initiatives measure success? I dig into the numbers that others might overlook.\nManufacturing Industry: I’m particularly drawn to how data drives modern manufacturing—production efficiency, supply chain analytics, quality control metrics, and market positioning. I visit facilities, attend open days, and analyze industry trends to understand how companies leverage data to stay competitive.\nWhy Microblogging?\nI keep my posts concise and scannable because I know your time is valuable. Each entry is designed to deliver insights quickly—think data-driven observations you can read with your morning tea. No lengthy essays, just focused snapshots backed by numbers.\nMy Approach\nI combine firsthand observations with data research, always citing my sources and showing my methodology. This isn’t just about sharing what I saw—it’s about understanding what the data reveals about our world.\nThanks for stopping by. I hope you find something useful, interesting, or thought-provoking here.\nFeel free to connect with me on social media. I’m always interested in discussing data, manufacturing, or local community insights."

    "text": "My Challenge\nIn September, I volunteered at a local BBQ festival (“Sagra”) in Piedmont, Italy, where hundreds of orders were being managed with paper and pen. As both developer and cashier, I faced a unique challenge: transform a chaotic manual system into a digital solution with zero budget, while actively using it under pressure. The real test came when WiFi collapsed during peak hours, fonts were unreadable in sunlight, and cooks needed to add new dishes on the fly.\n\n\nProject\nI developed a real-time order management web app that evolved throughout the event based on immediate feedback. The system featured an intuitive ordering interface, automatic order summaries, visual analytics with pie charts distinguishing dine-in vs takeaway orders, and Excel export functionality for post-event analysis. During the two-day festival, I implemented critical updates live - tripling font sizes for readability, adding batch order handling for large groups, and creating a dashboard that helped organizers make real-time decisions about inventory and pricing.\n\n\nResults\n202 orders processed without a single calculation error, €9,900 in sales managed seamlessly, and zero food waste thanks to data-driven decisions. The app reduced average order processing time from 3 minutes to 45 seconds, while providing organizers with instant insights that changed their sales strategy mid-event. Most importantly, this field test revealed that the best software development happens when you’re not just the developer, but also the end user under real pressure. The experience taught me that true UX isn’t about aesthetics - it’s about survival when there’s a line of hungry customers waiting."

    "text": "Rossmann Logo\n\n\n\nMy Challenge\nProcessing 1 million+ records from 1,115 Rossmann stores pushed both my laptop and analytical skills to their limits. I tackled this 2015 Kaggle competition to explore a critical question: how much does data volume actually impact prediction accuracy? The challenge involved comparing model performance between a small sample (1K records) and the full dataset (1M+ records) while optimizing for RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error) - the key metric Rossmann uses to measure forecast accuracy across their German drugstore chain.\n\n\nProject\nBuilt a comprehensive sales forecasting model to predict 6 weeks of future sales for Rossmann stores, originally designed to reduce analytical burden on individual store managers. The project involved extensive feature engineering from store characteristics, promotional calendars, and historical sales patterns. I implemented gradient boosting algorithms, handled missing values and outliers, and created time-series features to capture seasonal trends and holiday effects that significantly impact retail sales in Germany.\n\n\nResults\n38.9 percentage point improvement achieved by training on the full dataset - small data (1K records) yielded 50.91% RMSPE while the full dataset achieved 12% RMSPE, approaching the competition winner’s 10%. This dramatic difference validated a fundamental principle: in predictive modeling, data volume often outweighs algorithm sophistication. The intensive computational load taught me valuable lessons about memory management and optimization techniques essential for real-world big data applications. While I didn’t win the competition, achieving near-competitive results reinforced the importance of systematic feature engineering and proper validation strategies.\nTech Stack: R, XGBoost, Shiny, Quarto\nDataset Scale: 1,017,209 records | 1,115 stores | 41,088 test predictions\nKey Achievement: Demonstrated 75% error reduction through big data utilization"

This error highlighted the importance of thorough data validation—I initially wondered why so many pharmaceutical companies appeared to be based in African countries, Kazakhstan, and Vietnam before realizing my mapping error.\nEDA Complexity: The exploratory data analysis phase proved challenging with numerous variables and potential visualizations. I occasionally lost focus amid the possibilities, emphasizing the need for clear analytical objectives.\nPerformance Metrics Calibration: Creating meaningful performance scores required careful consideration. Initial calculations produced counterintuitive results like 6000% efficiency scores. Through iterative refinement, I developed a normalized scoring system that weighs three key factors:\n\nVolume performance\nPrice competitiveness\nDelivery reliability (measured by shipment delays)\n\nThis balanced approach produces scores that stakeholders can intuitively understand and act upon."

The USAID dashboard not only showcases technical capabilities but also provides genuine value for understanding and optimizing humanitarian medical supply chains. The combination of geographic analysis, vendor performance metrics, and product portfolio insights creates a comprehensive tool for strategic decision-making in global health logistics.\nThe experience reinforced that effective data visualization requires both technical skill and domain understanding—knowing not just how to display data, but what displays will drive meaningful action. As supply chains become increasingly complex and global, tools like this dashboard become essential for maintaining efficiency and ensuring that critical medical supplies reach those who need them most.\nThe dashboard is build with Quarto."
