    "text": "About This Blog\nWelcome! I’m a data analyst who believes that numbers tell stories—and those stories are all around us.\nWhat You’ll Find Here\nThis blog is my digital notebook where I document experiences and insights through the lens of data analytics. Whether I’m attending a local community event, touring a manufacturing facility, or exploring industry trends, I approach each experience with curiosity about the data behind it.\nMy Focus Areas\nI write primarily about two areas that fascinate me:\nLocal Events: I explore how data shapes and reflects our community experiences. What can attendance patterns tell us? How do local initiatives measure success? I dig into the numbers that others might overlook.\nManufacturing Industry: I’m particularly drawn to how data drives modern manufacturing—production efficiency, supply chain analytics, quality control metrics, and market positioning. I visit facilities, attend open days, and analyze industry trends to understand how companies leverage data to stay competitive.\nWhy Microblogging?\nI keep my posts concise and scannable because I know your time is valuable. Each entry is designed to deliver insights quickly—think data-driven observations you can read with your morning tea. No lengthy essays, just focused snapshots backed by numbers.\nMy Approach\nI combine firsthand observations with data research, always citing my sources and showing my methodology. This isn’t just about sharing what I saw—it’s about understanding what the data reveals about our world.\nThanks for stopping by. I hope you find something useful, interesting, or thought-provoking here.\nFeel free to connect with me on social media. I’m always interested in discussing data, manufacturing, or local community insights."

The data showed concentrated support in South, East, and West African regions, where HIV and malaria medicines were most critically needed. By visualizing shipment values on an interactive map, stakeholders can immediately identify:\n\nCountries receiving the largest volumes of medical support\nRegional distribution patterns and potential gaps in coverage\nUnderserved areas that might benefit from increased support, such as Caribbean nations\n\n\n\nVendor Performance Evaluation\nI developed a comprehensive vendor ranking system that evaluates suppliers across multiple dimensions:\n\nVolume metrics: Total shipments handled\nFinancial metrics: Total value of products delivered\nDelivery performance: On-time delivery rates and average delays\nProduct portfolio diversity: Range of medical products supplied\n\nThe top 15 vendor performance ranking reveals which pharmaceutical suppliers were most influential in USAID’s operations between 2006 and 2015, providing valuable insights for strategic partnership decisions.\n\n\nProduct Portfolio Analysis\nThe analysis examined the diversity and distribution of medical products, focusing on critical categories like antiretrovirals, antimalarials, and essential medicines. This helps identify supply chain strengths and potential vulnerabilities in product availability."

This error highlighted the importance of thorough data validation—I initially wondered why so many pharmaceutical companies appeared to be based in African countries, Kazakhstan, and Vietnam before realizing my mapping error.\nEDA Complexity: The exploratory data analysis phase proved challenging with numerous variables and potential visualizations. I occasionally lost focus amid the possibilities, emphasizing the need for clear analytical objectives.\nPerformance Metrics Calibration: Creating meaningful performance scores required careful consideration. Initial calculations produced counterintuitive results like 6000% efficiency scores. Through iterative refinement, I developed a normalized scoring system that weighs three key factors:\n\nVolume performance\nPrice competitiveness\nDelivery reliability (measured by shipment delays)\n\nThis balanced approach produces scores that stakeholders can intuitively understand and act upon."

When buyers can demonstrate impact through clear visualizations—showing exactly which products face delays and their financial implications—logistics companies are more likely to take corrective action seriously."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project demonstrates how modern data visualization techniques can transform complex supply chain data into actionable insights. The USAID dashboard not only showcases technical capabilities but also provides genuine value for understanding and optimizing humanitarian medical supply chains. The combination of geographic analysis, vendor performance metrics, and product portfolio insights creates a comprehensive tool for strategic decision-making in global health logistics.\nThe experience reinforced that effective data visualization requires both technical skill and domain understanding—knowing not just how to display data, but what displays will drive meaningful action. As supply chains become increasingly complex and global, tools like this dashboard become essential for maintaining efficiency and ensuring that critical medical supplies reach those who need them most.\nThe dashboard is build with Quarto."
