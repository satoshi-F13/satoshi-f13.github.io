I'm Satoshi, a Data Analyst living in Piedmont, Italy. I help local businesses and organizations make sense of their data by building practical tools they can actually use. I work with R and various data science tools, such as RStudio IDE, Quarto, and Shiny app. My goal is straightforward: take your data challenges and turn them into solutions that make your work easier.
