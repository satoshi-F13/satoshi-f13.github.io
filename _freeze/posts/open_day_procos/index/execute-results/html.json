Just attended their spectacular open day celebrating 80 years of operation since their founding in 1945. Over 2,000 visitors explored the facility alongside me, and as a data analyst, I couldn't help but dig into the numbers behind what I saw.\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg){width=\"600\"}\n\n#### **The Scale is Impressive**\n\nThe facility operates 24/7 with 500+ employees managing five independent departments across more than 50 production lines. Their multi-purpose production capabilities include:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### **Technology That Stands Out**\n\n**:** Walking through their production areas, I was particularly impressed by their Flow Chemistry Technology and High Pressure Hydrogenators (capable of reaching 60 bar). Real-time monitoring systems track hundreds of process parameters continuously across all lines.\n\n#### **Global Reach, Italian Roots**\n\n**:**Acquired by a Japanese company in 2006, PROCOS maintains its headquarters and R&D center here in Italy while operating sales offices across five continents.\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nAccording to the news article, in the Osaka EXPO 2025, the company announced [a bold â‚¬150 million investment plan over the next 8 years](https://www.ansa.it//piemonte/notizie/2025/09/29/annuncio-al-padiglione-italia-allexpo150-milioni-in-piemonte_8dd23b0b-dc49-4602-afa2-aa8cd1cdb73f.html)â€”a clear signal of their commitment to expanding capacity and technological capabilities in the specialty pharmaceutical chemicals sector.\n\nEight decades of chemistry excellence, and they're getting started to the brave future.\n\n\\\n\\\n",
